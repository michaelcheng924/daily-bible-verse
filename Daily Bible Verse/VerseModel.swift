                devotional: "This first verse of the Bible establishes that God is the all-powerful Creator of everything, the only eternal being that exists outside of time and space. Recognizing God's role as Creator helps us live with proper humility, awe, and thankfulness towards Him."

                verse: "John 3:16",

                devotional: "This popular verse summarizes the gospel - that God deeply loves us and sent His Son Jesus to die on our behalf, so that if we believe in Him we can have a relationship with God and eternal life with Him."

            Verse(
                verse: "Romans 6:23",

                kjvTranslation: "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
                devotional: "This verse contrasts the consequences of sin (death) and the gift of salvation (eternal life). It reminds us that on our own we only deserve death, but by God's grace through Christ, we can receive the free gift of eternal life instead."

                devotional: "Jesus proclaimed Himself as the only way to a relationship with God - He is the path to truth and life. This shows Christ's claim to be the long-awaited Messiah, the unique bridge between God and humanity through His sacrifice on the cross."
